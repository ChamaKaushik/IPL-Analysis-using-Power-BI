# IPL Data Analysis using Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) data using **Power BI**.  
The IPL is one of the most popular T20 cricket leagues in the world, generating a huge amount of match data every season.  
The goal of this project is to explore the data, create interactive dashboards, and generate insights into batting, bowling, toss, and venue performances.

## 📂 Datasets Used
- **Matches Dataset**: Team names, winners, toss details, stadiums, results, season  
- **Deliveries Dataset**: Runs, wickets, bowlers, batsmen, fielders, dismissals  
- Format: CSV files

## 🔎 Approach / Methodology
1. Data Collection – Matches & Deliveries datasets  
2. Data Cleaning & Preparation  
3. Data Modeling – Relationships in Power BI  
4. Dashboard Creation – Visuals for batting, bowling, toss, venues  
5. Insights Generation
